### Title & Description

**Full Title**: Strong Poison (Unabridged)

**Subtitle**: A Lord Peter Wimsey Mystery - Digitally Narrated Edition

**Description** (500 chars):
```
Harriet Vane stands accused of murdering her former lover with arsenic.
The evidence is damning, but Lord Peter Wimsey believes her innocent—and
falls in love. With only weeks before her execution, Wimsey must prove
his case to save the woman who has captured his heart. Dorothy L. Sayers'
1930 masterpiece introduces one of mystery fiction's greatest love stories.
```

**Long Description** (2000 chars):
```
"Are you trying to tell me that you've fallen in love with this woman?"
"I'm afraid so."
"But my dear boy, you've only seen her once."
"Twice. I saw her first at the Rushworth lectures last year."

When mystery writer Harriet Vane is arrested for the arsenic poisoning of
her former lover Philip Boyes, all the evidence points to guilt. The jury
cannot reach a verdict, giving her a temporary reprieve—and giving Lord
Peter Wimsey time to prove her innocence.

But Lord Peter faces an unusual complication: he has fallen hopelessly in
love with the accused. Now he must walk a delicate line between amateur
detective and devoted suitor, enlisting his network of helpers including
the redoubtable Miss Climpson and her "Cattery" of female investigators.

First published in 1930, Strong Poison marks Dorothy L. Sayers' introduction
of Harriet Vane, whose intellectual partnership with Lord Peter Wimsey would
become one of the most celebrated relationships in detective fiction. This
digitally narrated edition captures the wit, sophistication, and emotional
depth that made Sayers the queen of the Golden Age mystery.

Perfect for fans of:
• Agatha Christie
• British cozy mysteries
• Classic detective fiction
• Golden Age mysteries
• Period drama

| 7 | Cover, metadata, upload | 2 hours |

**Total Active Time**: ~16-19 hours
**Total Elapsed Time**: ~7 days

---

## Special Considerations

### Court Scene Formatting
Chapters 1-2 contain trial scenes with:
- Judge's statements
- Counsel questions
- Witness responses
- Jury reactions

**Approach**: Maintain formal pacing, clear speaker differentiation through subtle tone shifts (not full character voices).

### Miss Climpson's Letters
The novel contains letters from Miss Climpson with distinctive punctuation (many dashes and exclamation marks). Preserve reading style that captures her breathless enthusiasm without becoming annoying.

### The Cattery Network
Multiple minor female characters. Use same voice with subtle variations rather than attempting many distinct voices.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| British accent inconsistency | Medium | Careful voice profile selection |
| Court scene pacing issues | Medium | Mark for slower delivery |
| Character differentiation | Low | Focus on tone, not voice acting |
| Platform rejection | Very Low | Clean legal profile |
| EU territory conflict | Low | Block EU until 2028 |

## Series Potential

Strong Poison is first in the Harriet Vane sequence:
1. **Strong Poison** (1930) - PD 2026 ✓
2. Have His Carcase (1932) - PD 2028
3. Gaudy Night (1935) - PD 2031
4. Busman's Honeymoon (1937) - PD 2033

**Strategy**: Build audience now, have sequels ready as they enter PD.
