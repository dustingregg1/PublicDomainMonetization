# International Public Domain Arbitrage Research
**Research Date:** 2026-01-24
**Focus:** Cross-border copyright differences and monetization opportunities

## Executive Summary

International public domain arbitrage exploits territorial differences in copyright law to monetize works that are public domain in some jurisdictions but still copyrighted in others. The most profitable opportunities lie in:

1. **Life+50 countries** (New Zealand, most of Africa/Asia) where authors who died in 1975 are now PD (2026)
2. **Translation arbitrage** - Creating new translations of PD works to bypass copyrighted translations
3. **Canada-to-US pipeline** - Works PD in Canada but still protected in US until 2026+
4. **EU rule of shorter term** - US works simultaneously published in Canada get truncated EU copyright
5. **Regional distribution strategies** - Leveraging Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.in, and other marketplaces

## 1. COPYRIGHT TERM DIFFERENCES BY JURISDICTION

### Global Copyright Duration Overview

| Region | Duration | 2026 PD Authors (Death Year) | Key Details |
|--------|----------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **United States** | Published works: 95 years from publication | Works published 1930 or earlier | Publication-based for pre-1978 works |
| **European Union** | Life + 70 years | Died 1955 or earlier | Mandatory rule of shorter term for non-EU works |
| **United Kingdom** | Life + 70 years | Died 1955 or earlier | Follows EU standard |
| **Canada** | Life + 70 years (since Dec 2022) | Died 1955 or earlier | Previously life + 50 (created arbitrage window) |
| **Australia** | Life + 70 years | Died 1955 or earlier | First new PD authors since 2005 |
| **New Zealand** | Life + 50 years | Died 1975 or earlier | 20-year advantage vs life+70 |
| **Most of Africa** | Life + 50 years | Died 1975 or earlier | TRIPS minimum compliance |
| **Most of Asia** | Life + 50 years | Died 1975 or earlier | Includes India, major English market |
| **Japan** | Life + 70 years | Died 1955 or earlier | Changed from life+50 in 2018 |
| **South Korea** | Life + 70 years | Died 1955 or earlier | Extended from life+50 previously |
| **Brazil** | Life + 70 years | Died 1955 or earlier | Standard Latin American term |
| **Argentina** | Life + 70 years | Died 1955 or earlier | Standard Latin American term |
| **Mexico** | Life + 100 years | Died 1925 or earlier | **LONGEST copyright worldwide** |

### TRIPS Agreement Baseline
- **Minimum term:** Life + 50 years
- **Corporate works:** 50 years from publication
- **Developing countries:** Were given transition periods (expired 2005-2016)
- **Public domain preservation:** Works in PD before TRIPS need not be restored

## 2. SPECIFIC ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES

### A. Life+50 Countries (20-Year Window)

**Authors who died in 1975 are PD in 2026 in:**
- New Zealand
- Most African countries
- Most Asian countries (including India)
- Belarus, Bolivia, Uruguay

**Notable 1975 deaths now PD in these jurisdictions:**

| Author/Creator | Field | Significance | US Copyright Status |
|----------------|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Hannah Arendt** | Philosophy/Political Theory | One of most influential 20th century political theorists | Under copyright until 2045+ |
| **Barbara Hepworth** | Sculpture | Major British sculptor | Under copyright until 2045+ |
| **Walker Evans** | Photography | Influential American photographer | Under copyright until 2045+ |

**Monetization Strategy:**
- Publish in New Zealand, India, African markets where PD
- Target English-reading markets in India (5.83 billion book market, 55% English)
- Create regional editions with local introductions/annotations
- **Cannot distribute in US/EU** without authorization until 2045+

### B. Canada Arbitrage Window (Historical)

**Canada's copyright extension (Dec 30, 2022) eliminated future arbitrage but created a complex situation:**

- **Authors who died 1955-1971:** Entered Canadian PD under life+50 *before* the extension
- **Still PD in Canada today** (grandfathered)
- **Still copyrighted in US** if published after 1930

**Example Timeline:**
- Author dies 1962
- Became PD in Canada ~2012 (life+50)
- Remained PD even after 2022 extension (not retroactive)
- Still under US copyright if published 1931-1962 (95 years from publication)

**Monetization Strategy:**
- Publish via Amazon.ca targeting Canadian market
- Research specific authors who died 1955-1971 for works published post-1930
- Legal in Canada, cannot distribute in US

### C. US Works with Simultaneous Canada Publication

**The "Shorter Term Rule" Arbitrage:**

When US authors simultaneously published in US and Canada (common practice for 100+ years):
- Work's "country of origin" under Berne = Canada (shorter term jurisdiction)
- EU applies **mandatory rule of shorter term** for non-EU works
- Result: US works got only life+50 in EU (before Canada's 2022 extension)

**Impact:**
- Commercially significant US works typically had simultaneous Canada publication
- These works entered EU public domain 20 years earlier than expected
- **This arbitrage window closed Dec 30, 2022** when Canada extended to life+70

**Reverse Engineering Opportunity:**
- Research US bestsellers from 1920s-1960s
- Verify simultaneous Canada publication (check copyright pages)
- Check if author died 1955-1971
- These works may be PD in EU/UK but still copyrighted in US

### D. George Orwell's "1984" Case Study

**Perfect example of international PD arbitrage:**

| Jurisdiction | PD Date | Reasoning |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| UK/EU/Canada | Jan 1, 2021 | Life+70 (Orwell died 1950) |
| United States | Jan 1, 2045 | 95 years from 1949 publication |
| Australia | Jan 1, 2021 | Life+70 |

**Arbitrage Window:** 2021-2044 (24 years)

**What's Legal:**
- ✅ Publish new editions in UK, EU, Canada, Australia
- ✅ Create adaptations (plays, films, graphic novels) in those jurisdictions
- ✅ New translations in those jurisdictions
- ❌ **Cannot distribute those editions in US** until 2045
- ❌ US-based Amazon KDP cannot publish even with "UK only" rights (jurisdiction risk)

**Similar Works (Published 1949):**
Research other major works published 1949 by authors who died 1950-1955 for same arbitrage window.

### E. 1930 Works Now PD in US (2026)

**Major works entering US public domain Jan 1, 2026:**
- William Faulkner - "As I Lay Dying"
- Agatha Christie - "The Murder at the Vicarage" (first Miss Marple)
- Dashiell Hammett - "The Maltese Falcon"
- First four Nancy Drew novels

**International Status:**
- **Faulkner** (died 1962): Still under copyright in EU/UK/Canada until 2033
- **Christie** (died 1976): Still under copyright in EU/UK/Canada until 2047
- **Hammett** (died 1961): Still under copyright in EU/UK/Canada until 2032

**Arbitrage Strategy:**
- These are **PD in US only** for next 7-21 years
- Can publish in US via Amazon.com
- **Cannot publish in Amazon.co.uk or Amazon.de** (still copyrighted there)
- Must carefully select "US only" distribution rights on KDP
- Creates US competitive advantage window

---

## 3. TRANSLATION ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES

### Legal Framework

**Key Principle:** When original work is PD, anyone can create new translations, but each translation itself receives copyright protection.

**Example:**
- Original work by Tolstoy: Public domain worldwide
- 1950 English translation: Copyrighted until 2026+ (life of translator + 70)
- **New 2026 translation:** You can create freely, own copyright on your translation

### AI Translation Monetization

**Market Trends:**
- AI speech translation market: $5.73B by 2028
- 43% of consumers more likely to purchase in native language
- Edge translation (on-device) becoming mainstream by 2026
- Generative models draft translations, humans refine

**Arbitrage Strategy:**

1. **Identify PD works with expensive/limited translations:**
   - Classic literature only available in old translations
   - Academic works never translated to certain languages
   - Works in "exotic" languages (Russian, Chinese, Arabic) → English

2. **Use AI translation + human refinement:**
   - AI drafts full translation (90% of work)
   - Human expert refines for cultural/literary quality (10% of work)
   - Cost: Fraction of traditional translation
   - Speed: Weeks instead of years

3. **Target underserved language markets:**
   - **India:** Huge English market (5.83B book market, 55% English)
   - Hindi alone = 35% of volumes, leaving 65% to other languages
   - Shortage of children's books in Indian languages
   - **Latin America:** Spanish/Portuguese translations of English classics
   - **Europe:** Cross-European translations (German ↔ French ↔ Italian)

4. **Create translation series:**
   - "Modern English Translations" of archaic English classics
   - "AI-Enhanced Translations" with cultural annotations
   - Multilingual parallel editions

### High-Value Translation Targets

**PD originals with copyrighted translations still dominant:**
- Russian classics (Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov)
- German philosophy (Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche)
- French literature (Hugo, Dumas, Flaubert)
- Ancient texts (Homer, Virgil, Confucius)
- Non-Western classics (One Thousand and One Nights, Journey to the West)

**Strategy:**
- Research which translations are still in copyright
- Create competing translations using AI + experts
- Position as "fresh modern translation for contemporary readers"
- Market to academic institutions, libraries, general readers

---

## 4. REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION STRATEGIES

### Amazon Marketplace Arbitrage

**KDP Territory Selection Critical:**

| Marketplace | Copyright Verification | Public Domain Rules | Opportunity |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Amazon.com (US)** | Publication date (1930 or earlier for 2026) | 95 years from publication (pre-1978) | 1930 works now available |
| **Amazon.co.uk (UK)** | Author death date (1955 or earlier) | Life + 70 | Different catalog than US |
| **Amazon.de (Germany)** | EU rule of shorter term applies | Life + 70, shorter term for non-EU | US/Canada simultaneous = life+50 (historical) |
| **Amazon.in (India)** | Life + 60 years | Follows TRIPS + 10 | Huge English market, underserved |
| **Amazon.co.jp (Japan)** | Life + 70 (since 2018) | Changed from life+50 in 2018 | Recent change created confusion |
| **Amazon.com.au (Australia)** | Life + 70 (life+50 until 2005) | 1955 deaths newly PD in 2026 | First new PD authors in 21 years |
| **Amazon.ca (Canada)** | Life + 70 (since Dec 2022) | 1955 deaths, but pre-extension PD grandfathered | Complex transition period |
| **Amazon.com.mx (Mexico)** | Life + 100 years | **Longest term worldwide** | Avoid unless pre-1925 death |

**Critical KDP Requirements:**
- ✅ Must accurately indicate territory rights
- ✅ Amazon may request proof of PD status
- ✅ Public domain = **35% royalty only** (not 70%)
- ❌ Public domain **excluded from Expanded Distribution**
- ❌ Public domain **excluded from KDP Select**

**Strategy:**
1. **Verify PD status jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction** (don't assume)
2. **Create separate KDP editions** for different territory clusters:
   - US-only edition (1930 works)
   - UK/EU edition (1955 deaths)
   - India/Asia edition (1975 deaths in life+50 countries)
3. **Customize each edition:**
   - Local introduction by regional expert
   - Cultural annotations for local audience
   - Different cover art for each market
4. **Geo-target marketing:**
   - Run Amazon Ads only in territories where PD
   - Use region-specific keywords
   - Price based on local market (India lower than US)

### India: The Sleeping Giant

**Market Size:**
- $5.83 billion trade book market (2025)
- 55% English-language sales
- Fastest growing market for English books globally

**Opportunities:**
- Life + 60 years (TRIPS + 10, not life+70)
- Authors who died 1965 or earlier are PD in India
- **10-year advantage** over US/EU for works published post-1930

**Underserved Gaps:**
- Shortage of children's books in Indian languages
- Limited translations of Western classics to Hindi/Bengali/Tamil
- English market hungry for affordable classics
- Regional language publishing growing rapidly

**Strategy:**
- Target Amazon.in specifically
- Create India-specific editions with local introductions
- Price aggressively (Indian market is price-sensitive)
- Consider regional language translations using AI
- Partner with Indian academic institutions for credibility

### Latin America: Language Arbitrage

**Copyright Terms:**
- Brazil: Life + 70
- Argentina: Life + 70
- **Mexico: Life + 100** (avoid unless very old works)

**Opportunity:**
- **Spanish/Portuguese translations** of English PD classics
- Large literate population, lower book prices
- Amazon.com.br (Brazil) and Amazon.com.mx (Mexico) marketplaces
- Growing middle class hungry for literature

**Strategy:**
- Create Spanish translations of 1930 US works (now PD)
- Target Argentine/Chilean/Colombian markets via Amazon
- AI translation + native speaker refinement
- Regional cultural adaptations

---

## 5. LEGAL FRAMEWORKS AND RISK MITIGATION

### The Rule of the Shorter Term

**Berne Convention Article 7(8):**
> "The term shall not exceed the term fixed in the country of origin of the work"

**What This Means:**
- A work's copyright abroad cannot exceed its copyright at home
- EU **mandates** this rule for non-EU works
- US **does not follow** this rule (maintains longer terms for foreign works)

**Implications:**
- Foreign works may have **longer** copyright in US than in their home country
- US works may have **shorter** copyright in EU if simultaneously published in Canada (before Dec 2022)
- Creates asymmetric arbitrage opportunities

### TRIPS Agreement Constraints

**Minimum Standards (All WTO members):**
- Life + 50 years (minimum)
- Corporate works: 50 years from publication
- Cannot restore works already in PD before TRIPS (important!)

**Result:**
- Most countries now at life + 50 or life + 70
- Outliers: Mexico (life + 100), some life + 50 countries
- Developing countries had transition periods (now expired)

### Cross-Border Enforcement Challenges

**Territorial Nature of Copyright:**
- Copyright is inherently territorial (enforced nation-by-nation)
- A work PD in one country may be copyrighted in another
- Digital distribution complicates enforcement

**Practical Risks:**

| Risk Level | Scenario | Enforcement Likelihood |
|------------|----------|------------------------|
| **LOW** | Publish PD work in PD jurisdiction via local Amazon | Minimal - fully legal |
| **MEDIUM** | Publish in PD jurisdiction but work available in non-PD jurisdictions via VPN/border | Low - requires cross-border litigation |
| **HIGH** | Publish on Amazon.com claiming US PD when only PD in Canada | High - Amazon detects, account suspension |
| **EXTREME** | Willfully distribute copyrighted work claiming PD status | Very high - DMCA takedown, legal action |

**National Treatment Principle:**
- Copyright owners treated as nationals of the jurisdiction where infringement occurs
- Must comply with laws of each distribution territory
- "Deliberately targeting" a jurisdiction = legal exposure

**Best Practices:**
1. **Verify PD status** in EACH distribution territory independently
2. **Document your research** (copyright office searches, death dates, publication dates)
3. **Use KDP territory selection carefully** (don't claim worldwide if only PD in some countries)
4. **Maintain records** in case Amazon requests proof
5. **Consult IP attorney** for high-value opportunities

### Amazon KDP Compliance

**Public Domain Differentiation Requirements:**
- Must add "unique value" (can't just republish raw PD text)
- Acceptable differentiation:
  - ✅ Original introduction/annotations
  - ✅ New translation
  - ✅ Curated collection with commentary
  - ✅ Restored/enhanced images
  - ❌ Just re-typed text
  - ❌ OCR scans with no cleanup

**Proof Requirements:**
- Amazon may request proof of PD status
- Be prepared to provide:
  - Author death date + source
  - Original publication date + source
  - Copyright office search results
  - Analysis of applicable copyright term

## 7. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND RESOURCES

### Verifying Public Domain Status

**Essential Databases:**
1. **US Copyright Office** (copyright.gov/records)
   - Search pre-1978 works by publication date
   - Verify renewal status (pre-1964 works required renewal)

2. **Project Gutenberg** (gutenberg.org)
   - Reliable PD verification for US works
   - Includes international PD status notes

3. **Public Domain Review** (publicdomainreview.org)
   - Annual "entering the public domain" lists by jurisdiction
   - Scholarly curated, highly reliable

4. **Cornell Copyright Duration Charts**
   - Comprehensive chart of US copyright terms
   - When to use publication vs death date

5. **IMSLP Public Domain Status** (imslp.org/wiki/Public_domain)
   - Music-focused but comprehensive international overview
   - Country-by-country PD rules

**Research Process:**
1. Identify work + author
2. Find author death date (Wikipedia, Library of Congress)
3. Find first publication date (original copyright page, WorldCat)
4. Check EACH target jurisdiction:
   - US: Use publication date chart (if pre-1978)
   - EU/UK: Calculate life + 70
   - Canada: Check if death pre-1955 (or pre-1971 grandfathered)
   - India/Asia: Calculate life + 50 or life + 60
5. Document findings (screenshot, citation)
6. If uncertain, consult IP attorney

### Finding Arbitrage Candidates

**Database Queries:**

**Authors who died 1955-1975** (EU/UK PD but possibly US copyrighted):
- Wikipedia: "1955 deaths" category
- Cross-reference publication dates of their works
- Focus on works published 1931-1975 (would still be US copyrighted)

**Simultaneous US/Canada Publications** (may have shorter EU term):
- WorldCat advanced search: Published in US AND Canada same year
- Check copyright pages for "simultaneously published in Toronto"
- Common for major publishers (Scribner's, Harper, etc.)

**Translation Gaps:**
- Compare Project Gutenberg (PD originals) vs Amazon (available translations)
- If PD work has no/few translations → opportunity
- Focus on non-English originals (Russian, German, French)

### Tools and Automation

**Potential Tool Development:**

1. **PD Jurisdiction Checker**
   - Input: Author name, death date, publication date
   - Output: PD status by country (US, UK, EU, Canada, India, etc.)
   - Backend: Automated calculation using copyright term rules

2. **Amazon KDP Territory Optimizer**
   - Input: Work details + PD status by country
   - Output: Recommended KDP territory selection
   - Warnings about risky jurisdictions

3. **Translation Cost Calculator**
   - Input: Work length, source language, target language
   - Output: AI translation cost + human refinement estimate
   - Comparison to traditional translation

## 9. RISK ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION

### Legal Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Misidentified PD status | Medium | High (DMCA, lawsuit) | Triple-check research, document sources, consult attorney for high-value works |
| Cross-border enforcement | Low | Medium (account suspension) | Use KDP territory restrictions correctly, don't claim worldwide |
| Amazon content violations | Medium | Medium (book removal) | Follow differentiation guidelines, add unique value |
| Copyright troll targeting PD works | Low | Low (frivolous) | Maintain documentation, respond to DMCA with counter-notice |
| Rule of shorter term misunderstanding | Medium | Medium | Verify simultaneous publication, research country of origin |

### Market Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Saturated classics market | High | Medium | Focus on underserved translations, niche editions |
| AI translation quality issues | Medium | High (bad reviews) | Always use human refinement, not raw AI |
| Price competition (race to bottom) | High | Medium | Compete on quality/differentiation, not just price |
| Low discoverability | High | High | SEO optimization, ads, series strategy |

### Strategic Mitigations

**1. Differentiation is Everything**
- Don't just republish raw PD text (Amazon will reject)
- Add genuine value: introductions, annotations, modern translations
- Target specific audiences (students, book clubs, collectors)

**2. Build Series, Not Singles**
- "Modern Translations Series"
- "Annotated Classics for Students"
- "Complete Works of [Author]"
- Series get better visibility, cross-promotion

**3. Geographic Diversification**
- Don't rely on US market alone
- India/Asia offer less competition, life+50 advantage
- EU/UK for works US doesn't have yet

**4. Long-Term Portfolio Thinking**
- Classics sell slowly but forever
- 50-title portfolio generating $500-2000/month passive income
- Reinvest early profits into more titles

---

## 10. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

### Who's Already Doing This?

**Major PD Publishers:**
1. **Dover Publications** (US-focused, traditional)
2. **Penguin Classics** (high-end editions, expensive)
3. **Oxford World's Classics** (academic market)
4. **Numerous Amazon KDP publishers** (varying quality)

**Gaps in Current Market:**
- Few publishers exploiting international arbitrage systematically
- Limited AI-enhanced translations (still early)
- India/Asia markets underserved by Western publishers
- Life+50 countries (1975 deaths) barely touched

**Competitive Advantages:**

| Traditional Publishers | Amazon KDP Publishers | Your Advantage |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------|

## 11. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2)

**Research Infrastructure:**
- [ ] Build PD jurisdiction checker tool (spreadsheet or simple web app)
- [ ] Create database of authors who died 1955, 1965, 1975 (target years)
- [ ] Compile list of PD works by jurisdiction
- [ ] Research KDP territory selection best practices
- [ ] Identify translation opportunities (PD works with expensive/limited translations)

**Legal/Business Setup:**
- [ ] Consult IP attorney for jurisdiction-specific questions
- [ ] Set up business entity if scaling (LLC for liability protection)
- [ ] Create Amazon KDP publisher accounts (US, UK, India separately if needed)
- [ ] Develop contract template for freelance translators/editors
- [ ] Create documentation system for PD verification

### Phase 2: Pilot Projects (Month 3-4)

**Test 3 Strategies Simultaneously:**

**Pilot A: US 1930 Works**
- [ ] Select 3 works from 1930 (Faulkner, Hammett, Christie)
- [ ] Create differentiated editions (introductions, annotations)
- [ ] Publish on Amazon.com (US only)
- [ ] Track sales, reviews, ad performance

**Pilot B: AI Translation**
- [ ] Select 1 Russian classic for new modern translation
- [ ] AI translation + human refinement
- [ ] Publish multi-jurisdiction (US, UK, EU, India)
- [ ] Track cost vs traditional translation quotes

**Pilot C: India Market**
- [ ] Select 2 life+50 works (1975 deaths) or 1930s children's classics
- [ ] Create India-specific editions (local introductions)
- [ ] Publish on Amazon.in
- [ ] Test pricing strategies (₹199 vs ₹499)

**Metrics to Track:**
- Cost per book (development)
- Sales per month
- Review ratings
- Ad cost per acquisition
- Profit per book

### Phase 3: Scale What Works (Month 5-12)

**Based on pilot results, scale the winning strategy:**

**If AI translation works:**
- Ramp up to 2-4 translations per month
- Build stable of freelance refiners (by language)
- Create "Modern Translations" series brand
- Target academic institutions for bulk sales

**If US 1930s works work:**
- Systematically publish all major 1930 works
- Move to 1931 works (entering PD Jan 2027)
- Build reputation as premium PD publisher
- Explore audiobook versions (also PD)

**If India market works:**
- Expand to regional language translations
- Partner with Indian educational publishers
- Test adjacent markets (Southeast Asia, Africa)
- Create culturally adapted children's book series

**Portfolio Targets:**
- 20-30 titles published by month 12
- $2,000-5,000/month revenue
- Positive ROI on at least 60% of titles

### Phase 4: Systematization (Year 2)

**Build Repeatable Systems:**
- [ ] Automated PD research workflows
- [ ] Template-based editing/formatting
- [ ] Outsourced design (Fiverr/99designs)
- [ ] VA for KDP upload/management
- [ ] Ad campaign templates by category

**Expand Distribution:**
- [ ] Beyond Amazon: Draft2Digital, IngramSpark
- [ ] Print-on-demand globally (KDP Print international)

## 12. KEY INSIGHTS AND STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Top Opportunities RIGHT NOW (January 2026)

**1. US 1930 Works (Just Entered PD)**
- **Timing:** Perfect (just became legal Jan 1, 2026)
- **Competition:** Growing but not saturated yet
- **Differentiation:** Quality matters (most KDP editions are low-effort)
- **Recommendation:** Focus on top 20 most famous 1930 works, create premium editions

**2. AI Translation Arbitrage**
- **Timing:** Early adopter advantage (AI translation just became viable)
- **Barrier to Entry:** Requires language expertise for refinement
- **Opportunity:** Massive cost savings (70-95% cheaper than traditional)
- **Recommendation:** Start with one language pair you have expertise in, scale as you prove ROI

**3. India Market Expansion**
- **Timing:** India market growing 15-20% annually
- **Opportunity:** Underserved English-reading market, life+60 (not life+70)
- **Barrier:** Cultural understanding, local marketing
- **Recommendation:** Partner with Indian academics for credibility, start with universally known classics

**4. Life+50 Jurisdiction Exploitation**
- **Timing:** 1975 deaths just became PD in life+50 countries
- **Opportunity:** Authors like Hannah Arendt unavailable elsewhere until 2045
- **Challenge:** Smaller markets (NZ, developing countries)
- **Recommendation:** Target via Amazon.in (India), niche academic markets

### Strategic Principles

**1. Jurisdiction Arbitrage > Volume Publishing**
- Don't compete head-to-head in saturated US classics market
- Exploit timing differences (what's PD where)
- Target underserved markets (India, NZ, life+50 countries)

**2. AI Translation = Competitive Moat**
- Traditional publishers can't match your speed/cost
- Quality refinement is your differentiator
- Scale to 10-20 languages over time

**3. Build Series, Not Singles**
- "Complete Works of X" performs better than individual titles
- Series build brand recognition
- Cross-promotion between books

**4. Long-Tail Thinking**
- Classics sell slowly but forever
- 50 books × $100/month/book = $5,000/month passive income
- Compounding over years, not months

**5. Differentiation is Survival**
- Raw PD text republishing is a race to zero
- Add genuine value: translations, annotations, curation
- Target specific audiences (students, collectors, book clubs)

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**❌ Don't: Assume "public domain" = "worldwide public domain"**
- Verify jurisdiction by jurisdiction
- Document your research
- Use KDP territory selection carefully

**❌ Don't: Compete on price alone**
- You'll lose to $0.99 low-quality editions
- Compete on differentiation (better translation, better design, better annotations)

**❌ Don't: Ignore copyright term changes**
- Canada extended to life+70 in Dec 2022 (closed arbitrage window)
- Stay updated on term changes (Japan, Korea changed recently)

**❌ Don't: Use raw AI translation without human refinement**
- AI makes mistakes (especially cultural/literary nuance)
- Bad reviews will kill sales
- Always have expert human refinement

**❌ Don't: Overlook the "country of origin" rule**
- Simultaneous US/Canada publication affected EU term
- Research publication history for older works
