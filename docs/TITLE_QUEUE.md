## Tier 1: Launch Titles (READY)

### REVISED LAUNCH ORDER (Per Critical Review)

Start with LOWEST RISK title to validate pipeline before higher-profile works.

| Priority | Title | Author | Status | Risk Level | Why This Order |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|------------|----------------|
| **1st** | Last and First Men | Olaf Stapledon | ✓ Kit Ready | **LOWEST** | Global PD, zero EU restrictions, validate pipeline |
| **2nd** | The Maltese Falcon | Dashiell Hammett | ✓ Kit Ready | LOW | High demand, EU block until 2032 |
| **3rd** | Strong Poison | Dorothy L. Sayers | ✓ Kit Ready | LOW | British voice test, EU block until 2028 |

### Rationale for Revised Order:

1. **Last and First Men FIRST**
   - Zero legal risk (author died 1950 - already global PD)
   - No territorial restrictions - distribute EVERYWHERE
   - Tests full pipeline with real production
   - Niche but dedicated audience = quality signal
   - If something goes wrong, minimal exposure

2. **The Maltese Falcon SECOND**
   - Higher demand = worth waiting until pipeline proven
   - EU restrictions (block until 2032)
   - More competitive market - need quality proven first
   - Sam Spade character confirmed clear (1954 ruling)

3. **Strong Poison THIRD**
   - Tests British voice profile
   - EU restrictions (block until 2028 - shorter)
   - Series potential (Harriet Vane sequence)
   - Lower initial demand than Maltese Falcon
