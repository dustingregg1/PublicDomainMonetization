# Amazon KDP Public Domain Content Guide (2025-2026)

## Executive Summary

Publishing public domain (PD) content on Amazon KDP requires careful differentiation and adherence to specific guidelines. This guide provides actionable strategies based on KDP policies and industry best practices.

---

## 1. Current Differentiation Requirements for PD Content

### Amazon's Core Policy
Amazon **accepts** public domain content BUT requires **meaningful differentiation** from freely available versions.

### What Counts as Differentiation

**✅ ACCEPTED Differentiation Methods:**

1. **Annotations & Commentary**
   - Critical analysis footnotes
   - Historical context notes
   - Scholarly commentary
   - Reader's guides
   - Study questions
   - **Minimum:** Substantive notes on at least 30% of pages

2. **New Translations**
   - Original translation from source language
   - Must be YOUR translation (not copying others)
   - Include translator's notes

3. **Curated Collections**
   - Thematic compilations (e.g., "Gothic Horror Classics")
   - Chronological arrangements with transitional essays
   - Cross-referenced index
   - Introduction explaining selection criteria

4. **Enhanced Formatting**
   - Professional typesetting
   - Custom illustrations/diagrams
   - Enhanced navigation (hyperlinked TOC, footnotes)
   - Side-by-side original + modern language versions

5. **Educational Additions**
   - Comprehension questions
   - Vocabulary lists
   - Historical timelines
   - Author biographies
   - Literary analysis essays

**❌ NOT SUFFICIENT Alone:**
- New cover design only
- Minor formatting changes
- Adding a brief introduction (< 5 pages)
- Simply reformatting Project Gutenberg text
- Spell-checking or modernizing punctuation only

### Verification Checklist
Before publishing, ensure you can answer "YES" to:
- [ ] Does my version add 20%+ new content by page count?
- [ ] Would a reader choose this over the free version for the added value?
- [ ] Is the differentiation visible in the preview (Look Inside)?
- [ ] Have I clearly described the unique value in the book description?

## 2. Royalty Structure (35% vs 70%)

### 70% Royalty Requirements

To qualify for 70% royalty on public domain books:

**✅ Must Meet ALL:**
1. **Price Range:** $2.99 - $9.99 USD
2. **File Size:** < 10 MB (after compression)
3. **Eligible Territories:** Book must be available in territories where 70% is offered
4. **Not Public Domain Everywhere:** The content must not be public domain in ALL territories
   - **CRITICAL:** Most pre-1928 US PD content is STILL copyrighted in EU/UK
   - Annotated editions can qualify if annotations are copyrightable
5. **Delivery Costs Deducted:** Amazon deducts $0.15/MB from royalty

### 35% Royalty

**Default for:**
- Books priced < $2.99 or > $9.99
- Pure PD content without substantial additions
- Books > 10 MB
- Books distributed in territories without 70% option

### Royalty Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Price at $2.99-$9.99**
- Optimal price for annotated PD: **$4.99-$6.99**
- Justifies differentiation premium
- Maximizes royalty percentage

**Strategy 2: Keep File Size Under 10 MB**
- Use compressed images (JPEG at 70-80% quality)
- Avoid high-res scans
- Use efficient formatting
- Target: 5-8 MB for safety margin

**Strategy 3: Emphasize Copyrightable Additions**
- Highlight annotations, commentary, new translations
- Makes it harder for Amazon to classify as "pure PD"

**Example Calculation:**
- Book priced at $5.99
- File size: 6 MB
- 70% royalty: $5.99 × 0.70 = $4.19
- Delivery deduction: 6 MB × $0.15 = $0.90
- **Net royalty: $3.29 per sale**

vs.

- Same book at $9.99 (35%)
- 35% royalty: $9.99 × 0.35 = $3.50
- **Net royalty: $3.50 per sale**

**Insight:** For larger files, 35% at higher price may net similar or better royalty.

## 3. KDP Select Enrollment: Pros/Cons for PD Content

### What is KDP Select?
- Exclusive distribution through Amazon (90-day terms, auto-renews)
- Access to Kindle Unlimited (KU) and Kindle Owners' Lending Library (KOLL)
- Promotional tools: Free Book Promotions, Countdown Deals

### PROS for Public Domain Content

1. **Kindle Unlimited Revenue**
   - Earn per page read (~$0.004/page in 2025)
   - PD books with substantial content (300+ pages) can earn well
   - Readers more willing to "try" PD classics via KU

2. **Promotional Tools**
   - 5 Free Promo Days per 90-day period
   - Countdown Deals drive visibility
   - Critical for new PD releases without review history

3. **Algorithmic Boost**
   - KU reads count toward sales rank
   - Better visibility in "Also Boughts"
   - Amazon favors Select books in recommendations

4. **Competitive Advantage**
   - If competitors are wide, Select gives edge
   - Many PD publishers go wide = opportunity

### CONS for Public Domain Content

1. **Exclusivity Requirement**
   - Cannot publish on Apple Books, Kobo, Google Play, etc.
   - Limits reach to non-Amazon readers
   - Can't capitalize on niche PD markets (academic, library)

2. **Revenue Dependency**
   - KU page read rates fluctuate
   - Amazon can change rules anytime
   - Single point of failure

3. **Brand Building Limitations**
   - Can't build email list via other platforms
   - Can't leverage Draft2Digital's wide distribution
   - Limits long-term platform independence

4. **Competition with Free**
   - Readers can find PD content free elsewhere
   - Select doesn't prevent this competition

### Strategic Recommendation

**ENROLL IN SELECT IF:**
- New publisher building catalog (need algorithmic boost)
- Heavy annotated editions (300+ pages) ideal for KU
- Targeting mainstream PD classics (high KU readership)
- Limited time to manage multiple platforms

**GO WIDE IF:**
- Established catalog with consistent sales
- Niche PD content (academic, specialized)
- Building long-term brand independence
- Targeting international markets (Apple Books strong in EU)

**Hybrid Approach:**
1. Launch in Select for first 90 days (use promo days)
2. Evaluate KU revenue vs. potential wide revenue
3. Opt out if wide distribution seems more profitable
4. Re-enroll for specific promotional campaigns

## 4. Common Rejection Reasons & How to Avoid Them

### Top 5 Rejection Reasons for PD Content

#### 1. **Insufficient Differentiation**

**Rejection Message:**
> "The content you are trying to publish appears to be in the public domain or freely available on the web. We are not accepting this content at this time."

**How to Avoid:**
- Add minimum 20% new content (annotations, essays, study guides)
- Make differentiation visible in first 10% (Look Inside preview)
- Include "Annotated Edition" or "Study Guide Edition" in title
- Write compelling book description highlighting unique additions

**Example Fix:**
```
BEFORE: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
AFTER: Pride and Prejudice: Annotated Student Edition
        with Critical Essays, Historical Context, and Study Questions
```

#### 2. **Copied Content from Other KDP Books**

**Rejection Message:**
> "We found that your book has content that already exists in another book available on Amazon."

**How to Avoid:**
- Don't copy annotations from other published editions
- Create original commentary/notes
- Use different source text (compare Project Gutenberg vs. Oxford World's Classics)
- Cite sources properly if quoting scholars

#### 3. **Low-Quality Formatting/Errors**

**Rejection Message:**
> "The book you submitted has quality issues that make it difficult for customers to read."

**How to Avoid:**
- Use professional epub/mobi conversion tools
- Proofread OCR scans (common with old texts)
- Test on Kindle Previewer across devices
- Fix broken links, missing images, formatting glitches
- Use consistent styling (headers, indents, spacing)

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Functional hyperlinked Table of Contents
- [ ] No OCR errors (common: "m" as "rn", "cl" as "d")
- [ ] Consistent font sizes and spacing
- [ ] Images display correctly
- [ ] Footnotes/endnotes linked properly

#### 4. **Misleading Metadata**

**Rejection Message:**
> "Your book's metadata does not accurately represent the content."

**How to Avoid:**
- Don't claim original authorship (credit original author)
- Clarify edition type in subtitle (Annotated, Illustrated, etc.)
- Don't use misleading keywords (e.g., "new release" for old text)
- Accurate category selection (Classics, not Contemporary Fiction)

**Correct Author Attribution:**
```
Author: Jane Austen
Editor/Contributor: [Your Name or Imprint]
Title: Pride and Prejudice (Annotated Edition with Reader's Guide)
```

#### 5. **Content Quality/Spam**

**Rejection Message:**
> "We are not accepting your book for publication at this time."

**How to Avoid:**
- Don't publish same PD text with minimal changes across multiple "editions"
- Avoid excessive keyword stuffing in description
- Ensure annotations add real value (not generic ChatGPT fluff)
- Space out publications (don't upload 20 PD books in one day)

### Pre-Submission Checklist

Before clicking "Publish":
- [ ] Preview book on Kindle Previewer (iOS, Android, Kindle devices)
- [ ] Have 3 people review for typos/formatting
- [ ] Verify differentiation is VISIBLE in first 10% (Look Inside)

- [ ] Test all hyperlinks and footnotes
- [ ] Review book description for accuracy (no misleading claims)

## 5. Metadata Optimization for PD Annotated Editions

### Title Optimization

**Format:** [Original Title]: [Edition Type] | [Value Proposition]

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Moby-Dick: Annotated Edition with Marine Biology Notes and Whaling History"
- ✅ "The Art of War: Modern Business Applications with Case Studies"
- ✅ "Frankenstein: Student Edition with Critical Essays and Discussion Questions"

**Title Best Practices:**
- Include "Annotated," "Illustrated," "Student Edition," etc.
- Front-load searchable keywords (original title first)
- Keep subtitle under 100 characters for mobile display
- Highlight unique value (what makes THIS edition different)

### Subtitle Strategy

Use subtitle to:
1. Clarify edition type
2. Target specific audience
3. Include secondary keywords

**Example:**
```
Title: Pride and Prejudice
Subtitle: Annotated for Modern Readers with Historical Context,
          Character Analysis, and Discussion Questions
```

### Keywords (7 slots)

**Strategy:** Mix high-volume classics keywords + niche differentiation terms

**Example for Annotated Moby-Dick:**
1. "classic literature"
2. "19th century American literature"
3. "annotated classics"
4. "whaling history"
5. "Melville"
6. "maritime fiction"
7. "American novels"

**Keyword Research Tools:**
- Amazon search autocomplete
- Publisher Rocket / KDP Rocket
- Analyze competitor bestseller keywords

**Avoid:**
- Trademarked terms (CliffsNotes, SparkNotes)
- Irrelevant trending keywords
- Competitor book titles

### Categories (10 available)

**Primary Categories for PD:**
- Fiction > Classics
- Literature & Fiction > History & Criticism
- Education & Reference > Study Guides
- Literature & Fiction > [Genre] > Classics (e.g., Gothic, Romance)

**Secondary/Niche Categories:**
- Specific time periods (Victorian, Renaissance)
- Regional (American, British, European)

**Pro Tip:** Email KDP support to add books to additional categories beyond the 10 you select.

## 6. Review & Rating Strategies for New Releases

### The Cold Start Problem

New PD releases face:

- Competing with editions that have 1000+ reviews

### Ethical Review Generation Strategies

#### 1. **Amazon Vine Program**
- Enrollment requires Brand Registry + professional imprint
- Amazon selects reviewers to receive free copies
- Reviews marked as "Vine Voice"
- **Cost:** Free copies + Brand Registry fee (~$200/year)

#### 2. **Advance Reader Copies (ARCs)**
- Build email list of readers interested in classics
- Offer free/discounted copies in exchange for honest reviews
- Use services like BookSprout, BookFunnel
- **CRITICAL:** Readers must disclose they received free copy

#### 3. **Book Clubs & Reading Groups**
- Contact online book clubs reading classics
- Offer discounted copies for group discussion
- Request honest reviews post-discussion
- Target: Goodreads groups, Facebook book clubs

#### 4. **Academic/Educational Outreach**
- Contact teachers/professors who assign the original text
- Offer review copies highlighting educational features
- Request reviews from educators (highly credible)

#### 5. **Influencer Partnerships**
- Reach out to BookTube, Bookstagram creators
- Focus on niche influencers (classic lit, students)
- Offer free copies for honest review
- Track results via custom author page links

### What NOT to Do

**❌ Prohibited/Risky Tactics:**
- Buying reviews (violates Amazon TOS = account ban)
- Review swaps with other authors
- Incentivized reviews (offering payment/prizes)
- Fake reviews from friends/family without disclosure
- Review manipulation services

### Optimizing for Early Reviews

**Pre-Launch (2-4 weeks before):**
1. Build ARC list (target: 25-50 readers)
2. Send ARCs with gentle review request
3. Schedule follow-up emails
4. Aim for 5-10 reviews by launch day

**Launch Week:**
1. Promote to email list
2. Run KDP Select Free Promo (Day 1-2)
3. Free downloads → more review opportunities
4. Post in relevant Facebook groups (check rules first)

**Post-Launch (Ongoing):**
1. Include "Review Request" in book back matter
2. Email purchasers (if building list) with review link
3. Monitor reviews and respond appropriately
4. Gradually build to 25+ reviews (conversion threshold)

### Review Velocity Targets

**Realistic Goals:**
- Month 1: 5-10 reviews
- Month 3: 15-25 reviews
- Month 6: 30-50 reviews
- Year 1: 50-100+ reviews

**Accelerators:**
- KU borrows (more readers = more review chances)
- Price promotions (temporary $0.99)
- Holiday-themed promotions (summer reading lists)

## Appendix: Sample Annotation Style

### Example: Pride and Prejudice Annotation

**Original Text:**
> "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

**Annotation:**
> **Historical Context:** This opening line satirizes Regency-era social expectations. In early 19th-century England, marriage was often an economic necessity for women, who had limited property rights and career options. Austen inverts the typical assumption—it was actually single *women* who urgently needed wealthy husbands for financial security, not the reverse. This ironic tone sets up the novel's critique of marriage as a market transaction.
>
> **Literary Analysis:** Note Austen's use of free indirect discourse—the narrative voice adopts Mrs. Bennet's perspective without direct quotation, revealing the social pressures driving the plot while maintaining authorial distance.
>
> **Discussion Question:** How does this opening challenge or reinforce modern assumptions about marriage and relationships?

**What Makes This Work:**
- Explains historical context modern readers miss
- Connects to broader themes
- Analyzes literary technique
- Engages reader with question
- Substantive (adds real value beyond the text)

This level of annotation, applied consistently throughout a text, creates clear differentiation and justifies premium pricing.
