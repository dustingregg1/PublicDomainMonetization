# Multi-AI Review Request

## What This PR Does
This PR triggers a comprehensive multi-AI review of the entire Public Domain Monetization plan.

## Review Scope
All AIs should review with **extreme skepticism** and **contrarian attitude**:

### 1. Revenue Projections (CRITICAL)
The current projection claims $5,000-7,000 Year 1. This needs brutal validation:
- Is 20 ebook sales/month/title realistic or fantasy?
- What do actual KDP annotated edition sales look like?
- What's the failure rate for new KDP publishers?
- Are the royalty calculations correct?

### 2. Legal Risk Assessment
- Is the trademark analysis thorough enough?
- What's the actual DMCA/takedown rate for PD content on KDP?
- Are there hidden legal traps (derivative works, translations, etc.)?
- International rights complications?

### 3. Market Validation
- How saturated is the "annotated classics" market?
- Who are the actual competitors and what are their sales?
- Is there real demand for 1930 works specifically?
- Search volume data for target titles?

### 4. Execution Feasibility
- Is 18-22 hours for first title realistic?
- Can one person actually produce 10 titles in Year 1?
- What's the actual learning curve?
- Hidden time sinks not accounted for?

### 5. Platform Risk
- KDP algorithm changes?
- Review bombing from competitors?
- Account suspension risks?
- Terms of service landmines?

## Expected Output
Each reviewer should produce:
1. **Kill shots** - Reasons this plan could completely fail
2. **Blind spots** - What the plan doesn't consider
3. **Revised projections** - Pessimistic / Realistic / Optimistic scenarios
4. **Go/No-Go recommendation** with confidence level
