# The Real Plan: What I'm Going to Do and Why

## The 30-Second Version

**What:** Using AI software on my new laptop to turn old books (1920s-1930s) into audiobooks and digital products.

**Why it works:** These old books are now legally free to use. Making one audiobook used to cost $3,000-5,000. Our laptop can do it for basically free.

**Realistic income:**
- Year 1: $500-1,500/month (after 6-9 months of work)
- Year 2: $2,000-4,000/month
- Year 3+: Potentially $5,000-10,000/month

**What I'm NOT doing:** Quitting my job, spending our savings, or expecting instant riches.

## Why This Might Actually Work (The Honest Version)

I had 6 different AI systems tear apart my original plan. They found serious problems:

### What Was Wrong With My First Plan

| My Original Claim | Reality Check |
|-------------------|---------------|
| $5,000/month Year 1 | More like $500-1,500 |
| 15-20 hours/week | More like 10-12 sustainable |
| 5 different businesses at once | Should focus on 2 maximum |
| No marketing budget | Need $200-300/month for ads |
| No legal protection | Need $2,000 upfront |

### What's Actually Good About This Idea

1. **The laptop IS a real advantage** - It can produce audiobooks that would cost others $3,000-5,000 each. This is not hype.

2. **The content IS legally free** - Books from the 1920s-1930s enter "public domain" which means anyone can use them commercially.

3. **There IS demand** - The audiobook market is growing 25%+ per year. People want audio content.

4. **The risk IS limited** - If this totally fails, we lose some time and maybe $2,000. We don't lose the house.

## The Actual Plan (Revised After 6-AI Review)

### Phase 1: Just Audiobooks (Months 1-6)

**What I'll do:**
- Use the laptop to create AI-narrated audiobooks
- Focus on one genre: 1920s-1930s detective/mystery novels
- Target: 40-50 audiobooks by Month 6
- Sell on Google Play, Findaway (NOT Amazon Audible - they don't accept AI)

**Expected revenue:** $200-500/month by Month 6

**Time commitment:** 10-12 hours/week (nights and weekends)

**Cost:**
- Legal opinion on first 20 books: $500
- Marketing/ads: $100/month
- Total Year 1 investment: ~$1,500

### Phase 2: Add One More Channel (Months 7-12)

**Only if Phase 1 is working:**
- Add print-on-demand art (vintage illustrations on Etsy)
- This takes less time and provides diversification
- Target: 300-400 Etsy listings

**Expected combined revenue:** $500-1,500/month by Month 12

### Phase 3: Consider Expansion (Year 2)

**Only if we're making $1,000+/month:**
- Add Spanish translations of best-sellers
- Consider other markets

## The Rules I'm Setting for Myself

### Family Protection Rules

1. **No work after 9 PM** - Evening time is family time
2. **Sundays are off** - No exceptions
3. **$2,000 maximum investment** in Year 1 (not counting laptop we already bought)

### Business Rules

1. **Focus on ONE thing** (audiobooks) until it works
2. **Check revenue every month** - if Month 6 revenue is under $200, reassess
3. **Month 12 checkpoint** - if under $500/month, decide whether to continue

### Exit Criteria (When I Admit It's Not Working)

- **Red flag:** Less than $200/month at Month 6
- **Stop signal:** Less than $500/month at Month 12 despite consistent effort

## The Honest Probability Table

| Outcome | Chance | What Happens |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Total failure** | 30% | Lose ~$1,500 and 500 hours. Laptop becomes gaming PC. |
| **Small success** | 40% | $500-1,500/month. Nice side income but not life-changing. |
| **Good success** | 20% | $2,000-4,000/month. Meaningful extra income. |
| **Great success** | 10% | $5,000+/month. Could consider going full-time eventually. |

**My expectation:** The 40% "small success" scenario is most likely. That's still $6,000-18,000/year extra for 10 hours/week of work.

## What I Need From You

1. **Your patience** - This takes 6-12 months before meaningful money comes in
2. **Your understanding** - Some evenings I'll be working on this instead of watching TV
3. **Your honest feedback** - Tell me if this starts affecting our family negatively
4. **Your support** - Celebrate the small wins with me ($50 first sale = big deal!)

## Why This Is Different From Other "Side Hustle" Ideas

| Most Side Hustles | This Plan |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Requires lots of money upfront | We already have the main tool (laptop) |
| Compete with millions of people | Targeting underserved niches |
| Depends on one platform | Multiple distribution channels |
| Income stops when you stop | Catalog compounds over time (passive) |
| Get-rich-quick promises | Honest 2-3 year timeline |

---

## The Bottom Line

**Best case:** In 2-3 years, we have $3,000-5,000/month extra income from a library of audiobooks I created.

**Worst case:** In 12 months, I've learned a lot about AI and audio production, we're out $1,500, and I have a cool story about trying something entrepreneurial.

**Most likely case:** In 12 months, we have $500-1,500/month in side income from something that mostly runs itself, and a decision to make about whether to scale up.

## Questions You Might Have

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes. Works published before 1928 (and some through 1930 starting in 2026) are "public domain" - legally free for anyone to use commercially. I'm getting a legal opinion on the specific books before publishing.

**Q: Will AI-narrated audiobooks sound weird?**
A: They're not perfect, but they're now about 90% as good as human narration for most people. And they cost 1/100th as much to produce.

**Q: What if Amazon changes their rules?**
A: That's why I'm not putting all eggs in one basket. I'll sell on multiple platforms so one rule change can't kill everything.

**Q: Can't anyone do this?**
A: Technically yes, but most people don't have a $3,800 laptop with a powerful GPU that can run the AI locally. They'd have to pay for cloud services, which destroys the margins.

**Q: What's the catch?**
A: Time and consistency. This only works if I actually produce 40-50+ audiobooks over 6-12 months. Most people quit after 5. I need to not quit.
